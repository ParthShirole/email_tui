#### What is a _TUI_

In computing, text-based user interfaces (TUI) is a retronym describing a type of user interface (UI) common as an early form of humanâ€“computer interaction, before the advent of graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Like GUIs, they may use the entire screen area and accept mouse and other inputs. They may also use color and often structure the display using special graphical characters. The modern context of use is usually a terminal emulator.

#### What is _Email_

Electronic mail (email or e-mail) is a method of exchanging messages ("mail") between people using electronic devices.

Email operates across computer networks, primarily the Internet. Today's email systems are based on a store-and-forward model. Email servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect, typically to a mail server or a webmail interface to send or receive messages or download it.
